# Kit

This is a kit to make my life as a programmer easier. It's meant to be used in 42 projects which means it follow the norminette format. It's simple. There are types and there are actions. And that's it!

 You got types. And you got actions. That's it. Include kit/actions/actions.h and you're ready to use whatever you want from the kit.
